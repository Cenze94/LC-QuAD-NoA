# LC-QuAD-NoA

This is the repository of "I know that I know nothing: Questions Answering with Knowledge Bases" thesis files. Biggest data, like models checkpoints, have to be downloaded from the links shown in the descriptions contained in the READMEs of each specific folder, which also explains their content.

- "Cluster" contains the code about the four solutions and their application to modify DeepPavlov results; it requires the files of datasets generated using "LC-QuAD-NoA" functions, and those obtained using the DeepPavlov version with the modified files contained in "DeepPavlov" folder. For code reproducibility, there are already LC-QuAD-NoA and DeepPavlov answers files.
- "Cluster_universitario" contains the code used with the University of Padua's Department of Mathemathics' Cluster, and so it's only for those who use this cluster.
- "DeepPavlov" contains the model modified files that I used during my thesis, and the explanation of which points have been modified, in case those files change over time.
- "LC-QuAD-NoA" contains the code for LC-QuAD-NoA dataset construction.
- "NarrativeQA" contains some files with the information I used for NarrativeQA dataset analysis.
